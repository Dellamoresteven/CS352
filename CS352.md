## Slides All.

## Font-end Scanner -> Parser -> Semantic Anyalzer







* val, var, def
* Recrusive definitions
* sideEffects (e.g., mutations, heap allocations)
* Parametric polymorphism (i.e generic functions) (C++ Templates)
* Interpreter vs Compiler. Know the differences
* Scanner => "1+1" = Literal(1) Ident("+") + Literal(1)
* Parsing => Takes the Scanner ouput and turns it into = Prim("+", List(Lit(1), Lit(1)))
* Be able to produce AST from a specific grammer
* Understand Context-free grammar and BNF notation
* Abstract syntax tree
* Common tasks:
  * Read, write and understand grammar rules in BNF
  * Cinvert BNF grammar into.a executable praser
  * Produce the AST given a grammar and an input string
* Semantic analysis (type checking)
* __Types__: Syntactic constructs to classift expressions and values
* Typing rules (i.e interence rules)
* Type inference 
  * The semeantatic analyzer in proj 3 implements a cominbation if type checking and type inference
* Typing derivation trees (Know how to make and read them)
* Type soundness: Well-types programs cannot go wrong
* Given a set of inference rules, command tasks:
  * reason and check if a program is well-types and identify type erros
  * write down the proof of well-typeness (i.e derivation tree) of a program
  * produce a types AST where types are annotated
  * Given a new tpy erules, reason about weather it breaks type soundness
    * i.e can we construct a program that is well-types, but it produces undefined behavior during runtime?
* Intermediate representations
* Many Its:
  * Continuation-passing style
    * Passing a continuation to every function call or branch 
    * non-tail transformations
    * tail transformation: Does not generate redudant continuations for expressions appearing in tail position
    * Correspondence to SSA
  * Common questions:
    * Given a program, transform it to CPS from rules (given)
    * Given a program, draw its control-flow graph
  * X86_64 stuff.
  * covariance and contravariance
